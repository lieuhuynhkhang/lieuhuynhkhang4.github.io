									<h2>Jonathan Dalia – IT Manager of Langer Transport Corporation</h2>
									<p>Contact and sources: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.comptia.org/blog/a-day-in-the-life-of-an-it-pro-it-manager">Article</a></p>
			
									<p>Dalia’s job is related to configuring, setting and maintaining all voice, video and data connections at their site. He frequently check backups, server hardware and disaster recovery systems. His daily task also involves troubleshooting incoming issues. When time is available, he would find ways to reduce cost and improve services for enhancing the systems. Through writing report, queries and  interacting with the company’s SQL (standard query language) he also manages data. His day would begin with addressing any critical issues first and foremost then moving on to more lower priority ones. After doing so he can turn his attention to ongoing projects. An example on a project is a system which drivers can use to update their orders and locations, built as units installed in trucks. These units are connected back to the database to provide real-time updates. The challenges he faces is troubleshooting remotely and helping users with fast-growing technologies. As he’s the only IT staff in a company that have 3 physical servers and 17 virtual ones, maintenance of all of these will be very difficult. Most of his days is spent at the company’s site for management of these infrastructure. As such, he doesn’t interact with people much since there are not even fellow IT professional working with him, however as an IT manager he does interact with people other departments of the company.</p>
