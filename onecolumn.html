									<p>Zach Hill is an IT Technician, so his work is involves a lot of different task, mainly it’s working on Windows projects because a lot of business is Windows based. Specifically he has a ticketing system and service desk so everyday he’s checking tickets and answering phones. There’s also going to clinics and his facilities. He also does a lot of user account creation and active directory (create user account and manages it). Next is doing computer imaging, setting up new images. One thing he pointed out is that every day is different. His skillset also include cyber security, internet marketing and mobile device management. As a technician he does everything and interact with all kind of people, from clients, investors/sponsor, to co-workers, he is also actively interacting with the general public through his youtube channel (with more than 900 videos created). Zach spend most of his time in his workshop with his PC with contain a variety of tool for Windows based work. The challenging part about his work is that is unpredictability, because his work is involve with a lot of things, so a lot of the time it’s just troubleshooting and rarely can he get to the thing that he wanted to work on.</p>
