								<h2>IT Technologies</h2>

								<h2>Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning:</h2>
								<p>One technology that for sure will be the gateway to the modern future have to be AI. AI is a general umbrella term for a very wide range branch of computer science. The term itself however is quite self-explanatory: AI is concern with creating machines, software that have the capability to perform task that typically requires human intelligence. The inception of the technology go way back to 1950 with Alan Turing (aka the father of modern computer science)  asking a simple question: “can machines think?”.  In order to answer the question, humanity have made leaps and bound in development to explore and discover this possibility. Nowadays, AI has already been integrated into the personal and social landscape. It’s functionality allow it to be develop into a huge number of product imaginable, a few being: AI chess playing, painting, chat bot, writing essays, driving cars, analyzing data, virtual assistant etc. Some AI is so advanced it can assist in high cognitive applications such as healthcare, stock trading, logistic, robotics, financials, some can even be electronic teachers. An AI is not programmed to solve specific problems but they are programmed to learn and solve complex problems. The relationship between deep learning, machine learning and AI is overlapping: Deep learning is the initial part of machine learning in which the neural network is trained to do a specific task. Machine learning is where the neural network is program to learn rather than to do a specific task. Finally, AI is a higher level Machine learning, where the system is most capable of performing and learning complex task similar to a human. One of the most sophisticated example of AI to date is Sophia – An Artificial Intelligence humanoid. Sophia is developed by Hanson Robotics and can express human gestures, facial expressions, and make face-to-face conversation by answering questions and make discussions on topics. To achieve this, Sopia utilize a combination of supporting technology including visual data processing and facial recognition. Shanghai has also made such technological advancement through the creation of Jia Jia – also a AI humanoid robot. This proves that state of AI all over the world is not only highly advance but is also evolving constantly. Once improvement in machine learning and deep learning algorithm is introduced, the resulting AI will be even more efficient. As discussed, AI leaps are possible due to a variety of upgrade in different technologies, a big one is data processers and big data. With the amount of data available nowadays through big data, AI can learn much more than they could before. Not only so, with enhanced processing capabilities, the learning and problem-solving procedure can be quick and efficient. </p>
								<p>With such a huge application AI will certainly have huge impact (both positive and negative) on society the more it’s implemented.  A huge positive impact it that it can improves efficiency of human’s task tremendously. Especially, AI can take up dangerous jobs and allow humans to avoid such risk. This may also allow people to gravitate towards more satisfying and engaging work, resulting in a more happy and fulfilling life. AI will also have huge impact in healthcare and medical section with its monitoring and diagnostic capabilities. Studies have shown that it could save medicine and pharmaceutical sector for up to 100$ billion annually. The true people who is benefited will be patient however, with better and more personalized treatment plans and protocols. Healthcare provider are also able to have better access to medical information to help better inform patient. The introduction of AI to trafficking to reduce jamming and accidents is already a big factor contributing to societal productivity alone. Face recognition technology can also aid in the detection and investigation of crimes, with tight government regulation and careful usage, this can be very beneficial without abuse to invade personal privacy. However, there are also many accompanying risk. AI and automation will certainly take away a lot of job by replacing human worker, but there will also be new jobs created to maintain those automations. The real problem is that human might it difficult to adapt to a new lifestyle and find another passion. Another big challenge is how to properly manage and control a technology that is potentially capable of having more intelligent than humans. What if what human ask for is their own destruction but we are yet to understand that? The case in the Avengers: Age of Ultron really raise a point. Ultron’s mission was always to save humans. But he is such an advance AI that he realize the most effective way to protect them is for them to evolve, and to evolve they need the threat of extinction. </p>
								<p>In my personal daily life, AI had already affected me and all of the people I know, mainly through the usage of internet devices. For instance, while I watch youtube, I know that the kind of video I watch is recognized, recorded and stored. The more I watch the more data the system will have. By using AI, these data will be analyzed and the AI will learn my watching pattern, it will know what kind of videos I usually watch, what topic I am interested in, how long I usually watch and even at what time I usually watch. This also apply to a lot of online application nowadays. Shopee for instance – an online shopping and delivery platform – also track the kind of shops I like to buy from, the kind of merchandise I usually buy and the AI will process these information to make recommendations. However this is only the tip of the iceberg. In the future when technology progresses even more, the biggest impact will be everything became more affordable, with mean middle-class income may have the luxury of an AI car. A car that can drive itself can auto park, auto pull up to your location at the push of a button on the key (such as in Tesla car). All of my daily processes may be automated and personalized such as a cooking bot, cleaning bot, there already are an fully AI voice control house. My hope for the near future (say in the next 3 year) is that such technology and comfort is more affordable to the common public.</p>

								<h2>Cyber Security and Privacy:</h2>
								<p>In this day and age Information Technology is advancing at an unprecedented pace. New technologies, new inventions, new ways to stay connected are the gateway to the future. Digital transformation therefore has certainly reshape the world and disrupt many common notions of history. One of these is the way we gather and store data. In ancient history human were only able to store information in physical forms and formats such as written paper. Nowadays we can store not only an insurmountable amount of data through digital devices and big data technology, but we can access that information anywhere anytime thanks to the internet. However, this became an double-edge sword as the information is now vulnerable to exploitation. Simply put, as the internet is a place where anyone can access, there are risk that people who have sufficient IT knowledge steal the data you put on the web. For this reason, Preventing this threat is an important matter, this is where cybersecurity comes in. Cybersecurity is the act of protecting computers, servers, networks, softwares and any internet-connected devices from malicious unauthorized access and attacks. Cyber security is made up of an adapting sets of tools, risk-management approaches, technologies, training and practices specifically caters to securing the integrity of data, networks, devices and so on. As such, there are many type of cybersecurity, some are as follows. Network security is concern with managing entering and exiting connections to prevent threats from illegal entry or spread on the network. Data Loss Prevention secures data by focusing on classification, location and observing information in rest, in use and in motion. Cloud Security is about protecting the data of cloud-based services and apps. Intrusion detecting systems or Intrusion Prevention systems locate malicious cyber activities. Identity and Access Management is used mainly to track employees access to protect internal systems. Encryption is a common process of encoding data to make it into random nonsense used in transferring data to avoid being stolen. Antivirus + Anti-Malware is another common one, it scans the device for threats. There are also many kind of cyber threats, some commons are as follow. Malware, stands for malicious software, it can be pc viruses, spywares, Trojan type or keyloggers. These are some of the common threat and will have direct damage on your device your record your action on the device. Ransomware is a fairly recent one in which a malware will denied user access to their data until an amount of ransom is paid. Phishing attacks is the act of gaining important personal information such as password, credit card info, ID via bait email or text message/phone call. Social engineering involves manipulating people to gain information through various means, this can overlap with phishing. Advance persistent threat is when there is an unauthorized access to a network or system for an extended period of time without detection. The need for cybersecurity now is multiply with the ever growing dependency on computers as well as the increasing production and usage of other devices like phones, tablets and basically any device that can connect to the internet in the modern era. Cyber security is constantly evolving and there are many notable example of successful implementation. Perhaps one of the most well-known is Apple. Apple’s product have been known to not only high-quality in both hardware and software, but one of the most astounding feature about them is also their tough defense against cyber threats. Apple pride itself on having no viruses, no bug and absolute defense against malicious software which plagues other operating system like Android. It’s actually so secure that the US government had to demand that they lower their device’s security so that the government could obtain important information. </p>
								<p>The impact of cyber security can be foreseen. As is it in itself not a revolutionary technology, rather, a supportive technology, its impact will be based on whether how inter-connected the world will become. As mentioned earlier, the current trend is that modernization and industry 4.0 is leading the way. This means businesses and institutions of all shape and sizes are depending more and more on technology, specifically digital technology. Banks accounts, funds, personal ID, records are no longer on written paper and is saved on cloud drive systems, even money can be only a digit on a screen now. This trend is only going to be more widespread and the more information uploaded, the more aggressive the malicious activities will occur, since there are more reward for hackers to work. This however is also an opportunity, since we can essentially have an arm-race between the people with ill intern and people creating cyber security technology. Potentially, this competition can create a lot of new jobs and also incentivize innovation of new technology. However, the fact of the matter is cyber breaches are growing in number every year and out-pacing the advancement made in security technology despite a huge amount of investment pouring into development. This will for sure have a catastrophic impact to society as a whole as timing couldn’t be more worse. As we put more and more valuable information onto digital platform we expect more security than the alternative, not the other way around. The negative impact of security failure will be most pronounced in middle income countries since they are just starting to embrace industry 4.0 and does not have the resources and knowledge to possess advance cyber security technology like high income nations. Low income nation is still not integrating technology well so they would suffer mildly. </p>
								<p>This technology will definitely affects my everyday life. I remember a time when I was younger and had a Windows computer with very weak security, and had a bunch of spyware and viruses I didn’t know what to do about. Not only did it nearly destroy my pc, re-installing windows wouldn’t work either, I lost a lot of valuable information and a lot of my childhood picture were lost with no back up. Since then I was always skeptical about the integrity of any digital storage procedure and always try to keep physical copies, backups of whatever important information I need. Nowadays however I can feel relatively safe while using pc because I know I have a reliable antivirus software like Kaspersky. As an adult now I have many important information such as credit card number, bank account, ..etc and I highly emphasize privacy. I have heard stories like webcam being hack and I cover my webcam on laptop for the same reason. On the same note, messages is also always a fear for me because sometime I have private information like passwords exchange with my love ones, and text message is still very vulnerable to hacking and being discovered because it was sent through the internet. There are cases of people losing all of their life’s earnings because their information was exposed. And the worst part is it can happen to anyone, surely everyone see the occasion celebrity scandal because someone hacked their phone and released sensitive photos or text. I feel that cyber security technology still has a lot of progression to do before it is actually what people hope it can be. But on the case that one day cyber security can be absolute and 100% safety, that will be a big leap for humanity as a whole, because from there on we can continue developing every other digital network technology without fear. </p>
