								<h2>Project Idea</h2>
								<p>For assignment 2, I decided to develop an smartphone app that combines to medical assistance and food delivery. Specifically, this will be a mobile app which run on both Android and iOS called RemMedis. The name of the app stems from the word “remedy”, which mean a treatment (usually in the form of food) to an illness. It’s a word play of the word rem and medi (medical). The name itself also somewhat describe the nature of the app: to provide people who are ill with food that can aid their recovery. </p>
								<p>The underlying motivation behind the initial idea of the app is the vulnerability of modern life to illnesses. The modern lifestyle is becoming more and more detrimental to societal health. There’s ton of major issues causing this, a few being lack of sleep, lack of exercises, overworking, etc.. It’s easy for people to fall ill. A few generations ago, family life is more co-dependent: when you have a fever, grandma has the folk knowledge and can make you a remedy soup. Nowadays, people are more independent, the youth is gravitating toward living alone, and many had to leave their home town to get a better job. RemMedis is not only an app that can provide u with suitable remedy suggestions but also find a restaurant to cook and deliver to you.</p>
								<p>Getting into the specific, RemMedis will be freely available for download from the Google Play store on Android and Appstore on iOS devices. It’s a app that contains a huge amount of information on common illnesses and disease, there’s also a wide variety of symptom detection that allows the user to determine what they are suffering from and most importantly offers a remedy (diet) that best facilitate healing. The next main feature of the app is connecting to Now (a food delivery service) and browse on local restaurant for specific remedy that is suitable for the user’s condition. This allows the user to order food specifically to their needs if they live alone and are too sick to cook. There will be an enormous database on medical information gathered from many experts and reputable sources including Wikipedia, healthline, webmd, medical practitioners and so on. The profit will come from advertisement for pharmaceutical companies which is shown on the app. When downloaded, the user will have to create an account to log in. Firstly, to sign up, the user need to provide their name, email address, gender, home address, nationality, citizen ID. After that, these important personal information will be encrypted and safely store away in a large database for cyber security reasons. After that the user will have to provide their age, weight, height, underlying medical records. After medical related information have been retrieved, the system will stored and used that information as reference for possible related future diagnosis. After logging in, the user will be asked to link their Now account to RemMedis for further access later on (since the ordering will happen through Now, RemMedis just acts as an added feature). On the main screen the user will have 3 action option: diagnosis, library and ordering. When click on diagnosis, a list of multiple options will prompt, each with a specific illness symptom, guiding the user to choose the ones that fits to what they are experiencing. A few of these will occurs until there are enough symptom for the algorithm to recognize and pinpoint an illness which fits with that of from the database. At this point, after some loading time the user will be presented with a complete description of the illness/es they may be having. This will also include some pointers, tips on what to do to alleviate symptom. Most importantly, a list of food items that could help the patient recovers will be highlighted and presented. Some food items will also have a recipe sheet depending on how extensive, updated the database is. An option to “find and order near me” will also prompt next to the food item name. The next is library, this will give the user direct access to the database library via search tool. The user can input keyword on the disease they want to learn about and will be presented with appropriate answer, basically like how the healthline website works. When using the ordering function, user can search for the food directly by its name through the search bar or through the link next to the food recommendation after the diagnosis function. After that the app will redirect to Now delivery, auto search for restaurant selling that food item (if any) and present to the user.</p>
								<p>RemMedis is an advance app develop under governmental approval, licensing and its information will be justified, constantly updated not only through already available knowledge but also information and studies from big hospitals and pharmaceuticals in the country. There will be a large data processing engine and huge backs up drives to properly store important information and ensures the best up-to-date browsing experience. Advance artificial intelligence technology will also be used to recognize and recommend the best restaurants, meal plans to best fit user’s preference. This can be done through the AI unit processing user’s previous orders.</p>
								<p>Programming RemMedis can be done through C++, Java but it can also be done through Python and I decided to use this as using Python to write app is simpler than the others. Apps can be written basing only on Python then converted into native source code used for multiple platform by PyMob. Since there will be a ton of data gathered from users I might require a lot of hard drive to store them and run the server. Realistically, my IT knowledge and ability is still too weak to successfully create such a project. But I believe this is simple enough to achieve with some mastery over app development skills. My best course of action is to first familiarize myself with Python taking on dedicated app developing courses.</p>
								<p>If the app is developed successfully, that will mean people will have less burden when living independently because they still can take care of themselves if they are ill and it also provide people with a platform to raise their understanding on health and medical issues. If the app became famous it will be even better because it will incentivized more restaurant to offers more remedies for the sick which is something still lacking today’s world. The impact is that it conveys a message to raise independency and awareness on health.</p>
