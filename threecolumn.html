								<h2>Feedback</h2>
								<p></p>
								<h2>Tran Anh Quang's feedback:</h2>
								<p>“After reading through the idea of the RemMedis project, I was impressed with the realities it brings to life. I agree with Khang about life in the 4.0 era, people are gradually becoming more independent, not dependent on their families. However, independent life is not easy, it always comes with health problems. Working pressure leads to daily meals tend to be "fast food", food at the store is really not safe for users. That will be solved by the RemMedis application you presented. First, the application is built to improve the health of people living independently, it diagnoses the disease immediately and offers the right food to reduce symptoms of the disease. On the other hand, it is possible that the symptoms of some diseases will be the same, for example abdominal pain and stomach pain, both of which will be very difficult to distinguish from the user. They cannot tell where the pain is coming from and when they find the wrong symptoms it is dangerous for the user. Second, when ordering, a complete dish will include many ingredients but should have a list of ingredients in the dish. The reason is that this ingredient may help reduce the disease, but maybe another ingredient will make the user allergic. In short, this is a good and necessary application for modern life, it needs to be widely developed. With some improvements, everyone's health will improve.” </p>

								<h2>My thoughts on Quang’s feedback:</h2>
								<p>Firstly I’m very grateful to receive feedback from Quang, as I understand that feedback is a crucial part of not only IT works in specific but all teamwork in general. Taking a dive into Quang’s feedback, I can see that he did a really amazing job of understanding and critically think about my project idea, which I’m very appreciative of. I will be skipping the parts where he make complements because as the creator of RemMedis I’m aware of the potential positive impact of the app on society. That is to say I highly agree with Quang on the fact that modern people are gravitating toward independent lifestyles and that can lead to unhealthy habits especially in eating. For the negative part, Quang also raise some interesting aspect that I haven’t thoroughly thought of when planning RemMedis, such as: self-diagnosis is inherently difficult and easy to get mix up. I think he has a bit of trouble in the way he express it but the point is there. The average person usually can’t have exact diagnosis only through a library. This brings up his second point: it can even get dangerous if the user gets diagnose with the wrong illness and get the food treatment, such as having allergies with certain food items. I agree with this perspective. To completely eliminate this problem will be too unfeasible however, because even doctors need hospitals with expensive medical infrastructure to get the exact diagnosis. So the best and most realistic way I can think off to improve this potential issue is putting disclamers so users know that if they feel something serious then they need to go to the hospital rather than self-treating, RemMedis only serve as a self-reference.</p>

								<h2>Huynh Trung Kien’s feedback: </h2>
								<p>“Reading Khang’s RemMedis project idea I can see a lot of immediate benefit and it is a good idea. I myself care a lot about eating and I often emphasize the importance of having a good meal. I also agree on the social benefit that RemMedis brings when encouraging people to be more independent. However, the library function is a bit redundant in my opinion people information are so available online these days.”</p>
								<p></p>
								<h2>My thoughts on Kien’s feedback:</h2>
								<p>“Kien have given me some simple feedback that are easy to follow. It seems that he has a decent comprehension of my general project idea and have put some thought into how to improve it. I deeply appreciate such sincerity in comments because through them I can learn the most. Like with Quang, Kien also acknowledge some of the interesting and potentially beneficial sides to RemMedis right off the bat. The only negative suggestion he mention of is removing the library function. Now Kiên said it was because medical information are widely available online these day on the internet so having that function is a bit redundant, I agree with him and have meditate extensively on the matter. After deep considerations, I figured there are some more reasons behind it. First, RemMedis already have an diagnostic function, so if the user wanted to know about their condition they can check it through there rather than having to choose between the two. Next, having an extra function and extra database not only means more cost but also more work to do, more coding, which led to more troubleshooting, and a less intuitive UI as the current trend is the simpler the app the better. So in general, eliminating the library function may seem like a small thing, but it may bring big changes and benefits.</p>
